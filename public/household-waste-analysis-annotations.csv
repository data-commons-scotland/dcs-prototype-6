household-waste-analysis-derivation,rural £/££,recycling bin,Fines (<10mm),📍,"We can see that rural £/££ households dispose of a lot of fine-grained material, i.e. Fines (<10mm). Also, they dispose of a sizable portion of it inappropriately in recycling bins."
household-waste-analysis-derivation,urban £££,grey bin,Green garden waste,📍,"Urban £££ households dispose of a lot of Green garden waste inappropriately in comparison to their rural £££ peers. Is that because urban £££ households have fewer convenient spaces in which to heap their garden waste! Perhaps, but it is foolish to make such inferences from data (such as this) which covers a relatively small number of observations."
