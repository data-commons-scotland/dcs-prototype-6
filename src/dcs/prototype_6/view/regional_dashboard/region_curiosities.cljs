                              which is set for 2025."
                              " The data raise some interesting questions. For example, they show that in 2017, a significant 
                              proportion of Aberdeen City's household waste that was previously going to landfill was instead

                              " Another, related questio relates to the increasing percentage of recycled waste after 2017. Looking at 
                              the absolute numbers, there has been a small increase in the amounts of waste going to recycling. However, 
                              there has also been a reduction in the total amount of non-recycled waste (i.e. the sum of " [:em "Landfill"] " and

                              " However, Aberdeenshire's business waste data shows that it is not only 
                                significantly higher than the Scottish average - it has also been generally increasing since around 2012."
                              " This increase seems to be largely driven by increases in waste in the " [:em "Vegetal"] " and 
                              " [:em "Animal and mixed food waste"] " categories."
                              " The data also show that both the total amount of domestic waste going to recycling and the fraction of all waste
                              being managed has remained fairly static for the past few years."
                              " This raises some intersting questions. Aberdeenshire is a rich farming area, which may account for the significant

                              the fraction of domestic waste going to recycling, to help aberdeenshire head towards the Government's targets?
                              Is it simply a matter of education, or do we need to accept that some regions have contextual factors such as
                              geography, access to recycling facilities, etc., and make the targets more sensitive to these factors?"]

                              " As one of Scotland's smallest unitary authorities, we might expect the total waste it produces to be lower than in other regions. However, 
                              it's important to note that the waste generated per person is also relatively small.  Inverclyde's household waste per person has been
                              consistently below the SCottish average and has been decreasing - in 2019, it reported the lowest household waste per person of any 
                              of the reporting areas, at just under 0l.36 tonnes per person."
                              " The fraction of household waste sent for recycling is also higher than the Scotitsh average, with less than 50% going to landfill 
                              every year since 2012. "
                              " It would be interesting to know what is behind these positive figures.  The generally high recycling rates compared to the national average 
                              might be a result of Inverclyde's small size, good transport links and therefore accessiblity of recycling facilities compared to more dispersed and 
                              geographically remote regions. However, the significant increase in recycling rates seen between 2011 and 
                              2013 suggests that something changed in the region in this period.  Were there changes to waste collections, processing, or perhaps people's 
                              awareness of the importance of waste? Or was there some other factor?  "
                              " The data on business waste also raise some questions.  For example, between 2014 and 2017, " [:em "Vegetal wastes"] " appeared to almost 
                              vanish from Inverclyde's business, only to return in 2018. Was this real, and if so what caused it - or was it because of a temporary change in 
                              reporting? Similarly, in 2018, the category " [:em "Common sludges"] " (which refers to sludges produced from waste water treatment and from food
                              preparation and processing) has reduced significantly.  Is this because of improved processes or because of changes to what businesses are operating
                              in the region - for example, has a food processing business closed down or moved away?"]
